# ⚠️ GENERATED DIRECTORY - DO NOT EDIT

This directory is automatically generated by the build process.

**Never manually edit files here.** All changes will be overwritten.

## Source of Truth
- Source: `extension/ui/` (TypeScript)
- Build: `npm run build:ui` (in extension/)
- Sync: `python scripts/sync_ui_bundle.py`

## Workflow
1. Edit files in `extension/ui/`
2. Commit → pre-commit hook auto-builds and syncs
3. CI verifies sync on every PR

## Why This Exists
The Python package (`pip install ado-git-repo-insights`) needs bundled UI files
for the `ado-insights dashboard` command. Symlinks don't work in Python wheels,
so we maintain a physical copy that's kept in sync via automation.
